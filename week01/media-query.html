                <h2>Helaman 5:12</h2>
                <p>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; 
                    that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat 
                    upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, 
                    which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>

                <p>Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his, 
                    that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of 
                    him who created all things, in heaven and in earth, who is God above all. Amen.</p>
